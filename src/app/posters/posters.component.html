      <p>Creating posters is for me cathartic and fun. It is not my vocation.</p>
      <p>
        Like others inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the Nineteen
        Sixties and Seventies, and soaring visions of world Peace, Love,
        Equality, and Justice, I saw my role in the world in, similarly,
        extravagant terms. However, a lifetime of managing individual and group
        conflict slowly, but effectively, chipped away at my overly mythical
        sense-of-self. Any remaining certainties, that were not already beaten
        down by humbling experience, were soon shattered by the way in which the
        world changed in the new century, rendering much of my previous world
        view irrelevant.

        My posters are a way for me to play with ideas, words, pictures, and
        typography- in an attempt to capture any moments of clarity that I am
        fortunate have about our fast-churning world. To the extent possible, I
        try to go past the usual polarizing issues (abortion, campaign-finance,
        gerrymandering, racism, sexism, Trump, Putin, or Modi) in order to
        reflect upon what I believe are the vital attributes of a thinking human
        and a humane society. Needless to say, sometimes my biases and
        frustrations come through.
