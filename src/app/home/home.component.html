        Welcome to MetaCulture’s new website. From 2005-2016 we were a dispute
        management consulting center in Bangalore India. Since 2017 we have
        operated out of Washington DC, focusing on:

        <li>Strengthening the values and culture of democracy.</li>

        <li>
          Educating about the stresses and vulnerabilities unique to liberal
          democratic society.
        </li>
        <li>Educating for complex thinking skills and dispositions.</li>
        <li>Educating for complex relational skills and dispositions.</li>

        In this website we hope to make it easy for you to: (1). Sign up for our
        signature DemoSapiens’ courses on Understanding Civilization and (2).
        Support my work by purchasing thought provoking artwork from my
        Democracy Bites collection.

        Over the past many years, I have consulted on complex disputes and
        conflicts, and managed relationships between racially, religiously,
        sexually, ethnically, and ideologically different groups. I have given
        innumerable talks across the world and taught people how to think
        differently about communication, conflict, diversity, democracy,
        relationships, and- themselves. Here’s what I have learned: Working in
        the housing sector, I learned about the reality of unequal power between
        tenants and landlords. Working in low-income neighborhoods, I learned
        about the vulnerabilities of homogeneous communities as ‘outsiders’
        moved in. Working with Hindu/ Muslim conflict I discovered the realities
        of negotiating conflicting value systems. Being an immigrant and working
        with immigrants I understood how cultural differences could not just be
        brushed aside with platitudes about tolerance or respect. Most
        importantly working to create and sustain ‘flat’, ‘participatory’ and
        ‘collaborative’ organizations, I developed a healthy respect for anyone
        who tries to run a genuinely liberal and democratic nation.

        MetaCulture’s courses and artwork come out of my work of over the past
        forty years. They are designed to help intelligent adults think
        differently and deeply about our personal role in sustaining culture,
        society, and civilization. I survived a master’s program in Critical and
        Creative Thinking in the USA, and an undergraduate program in Visual
        Communication in India.  I founded MetaCulture in 2005 in Bangalore
        India- and for good measure, we were once awarded the International
        Leadership Award by the Association for Conflict Resolution, USA in
        2010. During the past few years, our online courses have attracted
        students from around the world. Much of what I know today, I owe to my
        students and clients who were gracious enough to invite me into their
        messy worlds. I live in Washington DC and when I am not teaching,
        creating posters and cooking, am working on my much-delayed book on the
        many misconceptions about democracy, pluralism, and what it means to be
        a civilized human.
